<p> "Off there to the rightósomewhereóis a large island," said 
Whitney. "It's rather a mysteryó" </p>
<p> "What island is it?" Rainsford asked. "The old charts call it 
Ship-Trap Island,"' Whitney replied. "A suggestive name, isn't it? 
Sailors have a curious dread of the place. I don't know why. Some 
superstitionó" </p>
<p> "Can't see it," remarked Rainsford, trying to peer through the dank 
tropical night that was palpable as it pressed its thick warm blackness 
in upon the yacht. </p>
<p> "You've good eyes," said Whitney, with a laugh, "and I've seen you 
pick off a moose moving in the brown fall bush at four hundred yards, 
but even you can't see four miles or so through a moonless Caribbean 
night." </p>
<p> "Nor four yards," admitted Rainsford. "Ugh! It's like moist black 
velvet." </p>
<p> "It will be light enough in Rio," promised Whitney. "We should make 
it in a few days. I hope the jaguar guns have come from Purdey's. We 
should have some good hunting up the Amazon. Great sport, hunting." </p>
<p> "The best sport in the world," agreed Rainsford. </p>
<p> "For the hunter," amended Whitney. "Not for the jaguar." </p>
<p> "Don't talk rot, Whitney," said Rainsford. "You're a big-game 
hunter, not a philosopher. </p>
<p> Who cares how a jaguar feels?" </p>
<p> "Perhaps the jaguar does," observed Whitney. </p>
<p> "Bah! They've no understanding." </p>
<p> "Even so, I rather think they understand one thingófear. The fear 
of pain and the fear of death." </p>
<p> "Nonsense," laughed Rainsford. "This hot weather is making you 
soft, Whitney. Be a realist. The world is made up of two classesóthe 
hunters and the huntees. Luckily, you and I are hunters. Do you think 
we've passed that island yet?" </p>
<p> "I can't tell in the dark. I hope so." </p>
<p> "Why? " asked Rainsford. </p>
<p> "The place has a reputationóa bad one." </p>
<p> "Cannibals?" suggested Rainsford. </p>
<p> "Hardly. Even cannibals wouldn't live in such a God-forsaken place. 
But it's gotten into sailor lore, somehow. Didn't you notice that the 
crew's nerves seemed a bit jumpy today?" </p>
<p> "They were a bit strange, now you mention it. Even Captain 
Nielsenó" </p>
<p> "Yes, even that tough-minded old Swede, who'd go up to the devil 
himself and ask him for a light. Those fishy blue eyes held a look I 
never saw there before. All I could get out of him was `This place has 
an evil name among seafaring men, sir.' Then he said to me, very 
gravely, `Don't you feel anything?'óas if the air about us was 
actually poisonous. Now, you mustn't laugh when I tell you thisóI did 
feel something like a sudden chill. </p>
<p> "There was no breeze. The sea was as flat as a plate-glass window. 
We were drawing near the island then. What I felt was aóa mental 
chill; a sort of sudden dread." </p>
<p> "Pure imagination," said Rainsford. </p>
<p> "One superstitious sailor can taint the whole ship's company with 
his fear." </p>
<p> "Maybe. But sometimes I think sailors have an extra sense that 
tells them when they are in danger. Sometimes I think evil is a 
tangible thingówith wave lengths, just as sound and light have. An 
evil place can, so to speak, broadcast vibrations of evil. Anyhow, I'm 
glad we're getting out of this zone. Well, I think I'll turn in now, 
Rainsford." </p>
<p> "I'm not sleepy," said Rainsford. "I'm going to smoke another pipe 
up on the afterdeck." </p>
<p> "Good night, then, Rainsford. See you at breakfast." </p>
<p> "Right. Good night, Whitney." </p>
<p> There was no sound in the night as Rainsford sat there but the 
muffled throb of the engine that drove the yacht swiftly through the 
darkness, and the swish and ripple of the wash of the propeller. </p>
<p> Rainsford, reclining in a steamer chair, indolently puffed on his 
favourite brier. The sensuous drowsiness of the night was on him." It's 
so dark," he thought, "that I could sleep without closing my eyes; the 
night would be my eyelidsó" </p>
<p> An abrupt sound startled him. Off to the right he heard it, and his 
ears, expert in such matters, could not be mistaken. Again he heard the 
sound, and again. Somewhere, off in the blackness, someone had fired a 
gun three times. </p>
<p> Rainsford sprang up and moved quickly to the rail, mystified. He 
strained his eyes in the direction from which the reports had come, but 
it was like trying to see through a blanket. </p>
<p> He leaped upon the rail and balanced himself there, to get greater 
elevation; his pipe, striking a rope, was knocked from his mouth. He 
lunged for it; a short, hoarse cry came from his lips as he realised he 
had reached too far and had lost his balance. The cry was pinched off 
short as the blood-warm waters of the Caribbean Sea dosed over his 
head. </p>
<p> He struggled up to the surface and tried to cry out, but the wash 
from the speeding yacht slapped him in the face and the salt water in 
his open mouth made him gag and strangle. Desperately he struck out 
with strong strokes after the receding lights of the yacht, but he 
stopped before he had swum fifty feet. A certain coolheadedness had 
come to him; it was not the first time he had been in a tight place. 
There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the 
yacht, but that chance was slender and grew more slender as the yacht 
raced on. He wrestled himself out of his clothes and shouted with all 
his power. </p>
<p> The lights of the yacht became faint and ever-vanishing fireflies; 
then they were blotted out entirely by the night. </p>
<p> Rainsford remembered the shots. They had come from the right, and 
doggedly he swam in that direction, swimming with slow, deliberate 
strokes, conserving his strength. For a seemingly endless time he 
fought the sea. He began to count his strokes; he could do possibly a 
hundred more and thenó Rainsford heard a sound. It came out of the 
darkness, a high screaming sound, the sound of an animal in an 
extremity of anguish and terror. </p>
<p> He did not recognise the animal that made the sound; he did not try 
to; with fresh vitality he swam toward the sound. He heard it again; 
then it was cut short by another noise, crisp, staccato. </p>
<p> "Pistol shot," muttered Rainsford, swimming on. </p>
<p> Ten minutes of determined effort brought another sound to his ears 
- the most welcome he had ever heardóthe muttering and growling of 
the sea breaking on a rocky shore. He was almost on the rocks before he 
saw them; on a night less calm he would have been shattered against 
them. With his remaining strength he dragged himself from the swirling 
waters. Jagged crags appeared to jut up into the opaqueness; he forced 
himself upward, hand over hand. Gasping, his hands raw, he reached a 
flat place at the top. Dense jungle came down to the very edge of the 
cliffs. What perils that tangle of trees and underbrush might hold for 
him did not concern Rainsford just then. All he knew was that he was 
safe from his enemy, the sea, and that utter weariness was on him. He 
flung himself down at the jungle edge and tumbled headlong into the 
deepest sleep of his life. </p>
<p> When he opened his eyes he knew from the position of the sun that 
it was late in the afternoon. Sleep had given him new vigour; a sharp 
hunger was picking at him. He looked about him, almost cheerfully. </p>
<p> "Where there are pistol shots, there are men. Where there are men, 
there is food," he thought. But what kind of men, he wondered, in so 
forbidding a place? An unbroken front of snarled and ragged jungle 
fringed the shore. </p>
<p> He saw no sign of a trail through the closely knit web of weeds and 
trees; it was easier to go along the shore, and Rainsford floundered 
along by the water. Not far from where he landed, he stopped. </p>
<p> Some wounded thingóby the evidence, a large animalóhad thrashed 
about in the underbrush; the jungle weeds were crushed down and the 
moss was lacerated; one patch of weeds was stained crimson. A small, 
glittering object not far away caught Rainsford's eye and he picked it 
up. It was an empty cartridge. </p>
<p> "A twenty-two," he remarked. "That's odd. It must have been a 
fairly large animal too. </p>
<p> The hunter had his nerve with him to tackle it with a light gun. 
It's clear that the brute put up a fight. I suppose the first three 
shots I heard was when the hunter flushed his quarry and wounded it. 
The last shot was when he trailed it here and finished it." </p>
<p> He examined the ground closely and found what he had hoped to find 
- the print of hunting boots. They pointed along the cliff in the 
direction he had been going. Eagerly he hurried along, now slipping on 
a rotten log or a loose stone, but making headway; night was beginning 
to settle down on the island. </p>
<p> Bleak darkness was blacking out the sea and jungle when Rainsford 
sighted the lights. He came upon them as he turned a crook in the coast 
line; and his first thought was that be had come upon a village, for 
there were many lights. But as he forged along he saw to his great 
astonishment that all the lights were in one enormous buildingóa 
lofty structure with pointed towers plunging upward into the gloom. His 
eyes made out the shadowy outlines of a palatial chateau; it was set on 
a high bluff, and on three sides of it cliffs dived down to where the 
sea licked greedy lips in the shadows. </p>
<p> "Mirage," thought Rainsford. But it was no mirage, he found, when 
he opened the tall spiked iron gate. The stone steps were real enough; 
the massive door with a leering gargoyle for a knocker was real enough; 
yet above it all hung an air of unreality. </p>
<p> He lifted the knocker, and it creaked up stiffly, as if it had 
never before been used. He let it fall, and it startled him with its 
booming loudness. He thought he heard steps within; the door remained 
closed. Again Rainsford lifted the heavy knocker, and let it fall. The 
door opened thenóopened as suddenly as if it were on a springóand 
Rainsford stood blinking in the river of glaring gold light that poured 
out. The first thing Rainsford's eyes discerned was the largest man 
Rainsford had ever seenóa gigantic creature, solidly made and black 
bearded to the waist. In his hand the man held a long-barrelled 
revolver, and he was pointing it straight at Rainsford's heart. </p>
<p> Out of the snarl of beard two small eyes regarded Rainsford. </p>
<p> "Don't be alarmed," said Rainsford, with a smile which he hoped was 
disarming. "I'm no robber. I fell off a yacht. My name is Sanger 
Rainsford of New York City." </p>
<p> The menacing look in the eyes did not change. The revolver pointing 
as rigidly as if the giant were a statue. He gave no sign that he 
understood Rainsford's words, or that he had even heard them. He was 
dressed in uniformóa black uniform trimmed with grey astrakhan. </p>
<p> "I'm Sanger Rainsford of New York," Rainsford began again. "I fell 
off a yacht. I am hungry." </p>
<p> The man's only answer was to raise with his thumb the hammer of his 
revolver. Then Rainsford saw the man's free hand go to his forehead in 
a military salute, and he saw him click his heels together and stand at 
attention. Another man was coming down the broad marble steps, an 
erect, slender man in evening clothes. He advanced to Rainsford and 
held out his hand. </p>
<p> In a cultivated voice marked by a slight accent that gave it added 
precision and deliberateness, he said, "It is a very great pleasure and 
honour to welcome Mr. Sanger Rainsford, the celebrated hunter, to my 
home." </p>
<p> Automatically Rainsford shook the man's hand. </p>
<p> "I've read your book about hunting snow leopards in Tibet, you 
see," explained the man. </p>
<p> "I am General Zaroff." </p>
<p> Rainsford's first impression was that the man was singularly 
handsome; his second was that there was an original, almost bizarre 
quality about the general's face. He was a tall man past middle age, 
for his hair was a vivid white; but his thick eyebrows and pointed 
military moustache were as black as the night from which Rainsford had 
come. His eyes, too, were black and very bright. He had high 
cheekbones, a sharpcut nose, a spare, dark faceóthe face of a man 
used to giving orders, the face of an aristocrat. Turning to the giant 
in uniform, the general made a sign. The giant put away his pistol, 
saluted, withdrew. </p>
<p> "Ivan is an incredibly strong fellow," remarked the general, "but 
he has the misfortune to be deaf and dumb. A simple fellow, but, I'm 
afraid, like all his race, a bit of a savage." </p>
<p> "Is he Russian?" </p>
<p> "He is a Cossack," said the general, and his smile showed red lips 
and pointed teeth. "So am I." </p>
<p> "Come," he said, "we shouldn't be chatting here. We can talk later. 
Now you want clothes, food, rest. You shall have them. This is a 
most-restful spot." </p>
<p> Ivan had reappeared, and the general spoke to him with lips that 
moved but gave forth no sound. </p>
<p> "Follow Ivan, if you please, Mr. Rainsford," said the general. "I 
was about to have my dinner when you came. I'll wait for you. You'll 
find that my clothes will fit you, I think." </p>
<p> It was to a huge, beam-ceilinged bedroom with a canopied bed big 
enough for six men that Rainsford followed the silent giant. Ivan laid 
out an evening suit, and Rainsford, as he put it on, noticed that it 
came from a London tailor who ordinarily cut and sewed for none below 
the rank of duke. </p>
<p> The dining room to which Ivan conducted him was in many ways 
remarkable. There was a medieval magnificence about it; it suggested a 
baronial hall of feudal times with its oaken panels, its high ceiling, 
its vast refectory tables where twoscore men could sit down to eat. 
About the hall were mounted heads of many animalsólions, tigers, 
elephants, moose, bears; larger or more perfect specimens Rainsford had 
never seen. At the great table the general was sitting, alone. </p>
<p> "You'll have a cocktail, Mr. Rainsford," he suggested. The cocktail 
was surpassingly good; and, Rainsford noted, the table appointments 
were of the finestóthe linen, the crystal, the silver, the china. </p>
<p> They were eating borsch, the rich, red soup with whipped cream so 
dear to Russian palates. Half apologetically General Zaroff said, "We 
do our best to preserve the amenities of civilisation here. Please 
forgive any lapses. We are well off the beaten track, you know. Do you 
think the champagne has suffered from its long ocean trip?" </p>
<p> "Not in the least," declared Rainsford. He was finding the general 
a most thoughtful and affable host, a true cosmopolite. But there was 
one small trait of .the general's that made Rainsford uncomfortable. 
Whenever he looked up from his plate he found the general studying him, 
appraising him narrowly. </p>
<p> "Perhaps," said General Zaroff, "you were surprised that I 
recognised your name. You see, I read all books on hunting published in 
English, French, and Russian. I have but one passion in my life, Mr. 
Rains. ford, and it is the hunt." </p>
<p> "You have some wonderful heads here," said Rainsford as he ate a 
particularly well-cooked filet mignon. " That Cape buffalo is the 
largest I ever saw." </p>
<p> "Oh, that fellow. Yes, he was a monster." </p>
<p> "Did he charge you?" </p>
<p> "Hurled me against a tree," said the general. "Fractured my skull. 
But I got the brute." </p>
<p> "I've always thought," said Rainsford, "that the Cape buffalo is 
the most dangerous of all big game." </p>
<p> For a moment the general did not reply; he was smiling his curious 
red-lipped smile. </p>
<p> Then he said slowly, "No. You are wrong, sir. The Cape buffalo is 
not the most dangerous big game." He sipped his wine. "Here in my 
preserve on this island," he said in the same slow tone, "I hunt more 
dangerous game." </p>
<p> Rainsford expressed his surprise. "Is there big game on this 
island?" </p>
<p> The general nodded. "The biggest." </p>
<p> "Really?" </p>
<p> "Oh, it isn't here naturally, of course. I have to stock the 
island." </p>
<p> "What have you imported, general?" Rainsford asked. "Tigers?" </p>
<p> The general smiled. "No," he said. "Hunting tigers ceased to 
interest me some years ago. </p>
<p> I exhausted their possibilities, you see. No thrill left in tigers, 
no real danger. I live for danger, Mr. Rainsford." </p>
<p> The general took from his pocket a gold cigarette case and offered 
his guest a long black cigarette with a silver tip; it was perfumed and 
gave off a smell like incense. </p>
<p> "We will have some capital hunting, you and I," said the general. 
"I shall be most glad to have your society." </p>
<p> "But what gameó" began Rainsford. </p>
<p> "I'll tell you," said the general. "You will be amused, I know. I 
think I may say, in all modesty, that I have done a rare thing. I have 
invented a new sensation. May I pour you another glass of port?" </p>
<p> "Thank you, general." </p>
<p> The general filled both glasses, and said, "God makes some men 
poets. Some He makes kings, some beggars. Me He made a hunter. My hand 
was made for the trigger, my father said. He was a very rich man with a 
quarter of a million acres in the Crimea, and he was an ardent 
sportsman. When I was only five years old he gave me a little gun, 
specially made in Moscow for me, to shoot sparrows with. When I shot 
some of his prize turkeys with it, he did not punish me; he 
complimented me on my marksmanship. I killed my first bear in the 
Caucasus when I was ten. My whole life has been one prolonged hunt. I 
went into the armyóit was expected of noblemen's sonsóand for a 
time commanded a division of Cossack cavalry, but my real interest was 
always the hunt. I have hunted every kind of game in every land. It 
would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed." </p>
<p> The general puffed at his cigarette. </p>
<p> "After the debacle in Russia I left the country, for it was 
imprudent for an officer of the Czar to stay there. Many noble Russians 
lost everything. I, luckily, had invested heavily in American 
securities, so I shall never have to open a tea-room in Monte Carlo or 
drive a taxi in Paris. Naturally, I continued to huntógrizzliest in 
your Rockies, crocodiles in the Ganges, rhinoceroses in East Africa. It 
was in Africa that the Cape buffalo hit me and laid me up for six 
months. As soon as I recovered I started for the Amazon to hunt 
jaguars, for I had heard they were unusually cunning. They weren't." 
The Cossack sighed. "They were no match at all for a hunter with his 
wits about him, and a high-powered rifle. I was bitterly disappointed. </p>
<p> I was lying in my tent with a splitting headache one night when a 
terrible thought pushed its way into my mind. Hunting was beginning to 
bore me! And hunting, remember, had been my life. I have heard that in 
America businessmen often go to pieces when they give up the business 
that has been their life." </p>
<p> "Yes, that's so," said Rainsford. </p>
<p> The general smiled. "I had no wish to go to pieces," he said. "I 
must do something. Now, mine is an analytical mind, Mr. Rainsford. 
Doubtless that is why I enjoy the problems of the chase." </p>
<p> "No doubt, General Zaroff." </p>
<p> "So," continued the general, "I asked myself why the hunt no longer 
fascinated me. You are much younger than I am, Mr. Rainsford, and have 
not hunted as much, but you perhaps can guess the answer." </p>
<p> "What was it?" </p>
<p> "Simply this: hunting had ceased to be what you call `a sporting 
proposition.' It had become too easy. I always got my quarry. Always. 
There is no greater bore than perfection." </p>
<p> The general lit a fresh cigarette. </p>
<p> "No animal had a chance with me any more. That is no boast; it is a 
mathematical certainty. The animal had nothing but his legs and his 
instinct. Instinct is no match for reason. When I thought of this it 
was a tragic moment for me, I can tell you." </p>
<p> Rainsford leaned across the table, absorbed in what his host was 
saying. </p>
<p> "It came to me as an inspiration what I must do," the general went 
on. </p>
<p> "And that was?" </p>
<p> The general smiled the quiet smile of one who has faced an obstacle 
and surmounted it with success. "I had to invent a new animal to hunt," 
he said. </p>
<p> "A new animal? You're joking." "Not at all," said the general. "I 
never joke about hunting. I needed a new animal. I found one. So I 
bought this island built this house, and here I do my hunting. The 
island is perfect for my purposesóthere are jungles with a maze of 
traits in them, hills, swampsó" </p>
<p> "But the animal, General Zaroff?" </p>
<p> "Oh," said the general, "it supplies me with the most exciting 
hunting in the world. No other hunting compares with it for an instant. 
Every day I hunt, and I never grow bored now, for I have a quarry with 
which I can match my wits." </p>
<p> Rainsford's bewilderment showed in his face. </p>
<p> "I wanted the ideal animal to hunt," explained the general. "So I 
said, `What are the attributes of an ideal quarry?' And the answer was, 
of course, `It must have courage, cunning, and, above all, it must be 
able to reason."' "But no animal can reason," objected Rainsford. </p>
<p> "My dear fellow," said the general, "there is one that can." </p>
<p> "But you can't meanó" gasped Rainsford. </p>
<p> "And why not?" </p>
<p> "I can't believe you are serious, General Zaroff. This is a grisly 
joke." </p>
<p> "Why should I not be serious? I am speaking of hunting." </p>
<p> "Hunting? Great Guns, General Zaroff, what you speak of is murder." </p>
<p> The general laughed with entire good nature. He regarded Rainsford 
quizzically. "I refuse to believe that so modern and civilised a young 
man as you seem to be harbours romantic ideas about the value of human 
life. Surely your experiences in the waró" </p>
<p> "Did not make me condone cold-blooded murder," finished Rainsford 
stiffly. </p>
<p> Laughter shook the general. "How extraordinarily droll you are!" he 
said. "One does not expect nowadays to find a young man of the educated 
class, even in America, with such a naive, and, if I may say so, 
mid-Victorian point of view. It's like finding a snuffbox in a 
limousine. Ah, well, doubtless you had Puritan ancestors. So many 
Americans appear to have had. I'll wager you'll forget your notions 
when you go hunting with me. You've a genuine new thrill in store for 
you, Mr. Rainsford." </p>
<p> "Thank you, I'm a hunter, not a murderer." </p>
<p> "Dear me," said the general, quite unruffled, "again that 
unpleasant word. But I think I can show you that your scruples are 
quite ill founded." </p>
<p> "Yes?" </p>
<p> "Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if needs 
be, taken by the strong. </p>
<p> The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure. I 
am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should 
I not? I hunt the scum of the earth: sailors from tramp shipsó
lassars, blacks, Chinese, whites, mongrelsóa thoroughbred horse or 
hound is worth more than a score of them." </p>
<p> "But they are men," said Rainsford hotly. </p>
<p> "Precisely," said the general. "That is why I use them. It gives me 
pleasure. They can reason, after a fashion. So they are dangerous." </p>
<p> "But where do you get them?" </p>
<p> The general's left eyelid fluttered down in a wink. "This island is 
called Ship Trap," he answered. "Sometimes an angry god of the high 
seas sends them to me. Sometimes, when Providence is not so kind, I 
help Providence a bit. Come to the window with me." </p>
<p> Rainsford went to the window and looked out toward the sea. </p>
<p> "Watch! Out there!" exclaimed the general, pointing into the night. 
Rainsford's eyes saw only blackness, and then, as the general pressed a 
button, far out to sea Rainsford saw the flash of lights. </p>
<p> The general chuckled. "They indicate a channel," he said, "where 
there's none; giant rocks with razor edges crouch like a sea monster 
with wide-open jaws. They can crush a ship as easily as I crush this 
nut." He dropped a walnut on the hardwood floor and brought his heel 
grinding down on it. "Oh, yes," he said, casually, as if in answer to a 
question, "I have electricity. We try to be civilised here." </p>
<p> "Civilised? And you shoot down men?" </p>
<p> A trace of anger was in the general's black eyes, but it was there 
for but a second; and he said, in his most pleasant manner, "Dear me, 
what a righteous young man you are! I assure you I do not do the thing 
you suggest. That would be barbarous. I treat these visitors with every 
consideration. They get plenty of good food and exercise. They get into 
splendid physical condition. You shall see for yourself tomorrow." </p>
<p> "What do you mean?" </p>
<p> "We'll visit my training school," smiled the general. "It's in the 
cellar. I have about a dozen pupils down there now. They're from the 
Spanish bark San Lucar that had the bad luck to go on the rocks out 
there. A very inferior lot, I regret to say. Poor specimens and more 
accustomed to the deck than to the jungle." He raised his hand, and 
Ivan, who served as waiter, brought thick Turkish coffee. Rainsford, 
with an effort, held his tongue in check. </p>
<p> "It's a game, you see," pursued the general blandly. "I suggest to 
one of them that we go hunting. I give him a supply of food and an 
excellent hunting knife. I give him three hours' start. I am to follow, 
armed only with a pistol of the smallest calibre and range. If my 
quarry eludes me for three whole days, he wins the game. If I find him 
"óthe general smiledó" he loses." </p>
<p> "Suppose he refuses to be hunted?" </p>
<p> "Oh," said the general, "I give him his option, of course. He need 
not play that game if he doesn't wish to. If he does not wish to hunt, 
I turn him over to Ivan. Ivan once had the honour of serving as 
official knouter to the Great White Czar, and he has his own ideas of 
sport. Invariably, Mr. Rainsford, invariably they choose the hunt." </p>
<p> "And if they win?" </p>
<p> The smile on the general's face widened. "To date I have not lost," 
he said. Then he added, hastily: "I don't wish you to think me a 
braggart, Mr. Rainsford. Many of them afford only the most elementary 
sort of problem. Occasionally I strike a tartar. One almost did win. </p>
<p> I eventually had to use the dogs." </p>
<p> "The dogs?" </p>
<p> "This way, please. I'll show you." </p>
<p> The general steered Rainsford to a window. The lights from the 
windows sent a flickering illumination that made grotesque patterns on 
the courtyard below, and Rainsford could see moving about there a dozen 
or so huge black shapes; as they turned toward him, their eyes 
glittered greenly. </p>
<p> "A rather good lot, I think," observed the general. "They are let 
out at seven every night. </p>
<p> If anyone should try to get into my houseóor out of itó
something extremely regrettable would occur to him." He hummed a snatch 
of song from the Folies Bergere. </p>
<p> "And now," said the general, "I want to show you my new collection 
of heads. Will you come with me to the library?" </p>
<p> "I hope," said Rainsford, "that you will excuse me tonight, General 
Zaroff. I'm really not feeling well." </p>
<p> "Ah, indeed?" the general inquired solicitously. "Well, I suppose 
that's only natural, after your long swim. You need a good, restful 
night's sleep. Tomorrow you'll feel like a new man, I'll wager. Then 
we'll hunt, eh? I've one rather promising prospectó" Rainsford was 
hurrying from the room. </p>
<p> "Sorry you can't go with me tonight," called the general. "I expect 
rather fair sportóa big, strong, black. He looks resourcefulóWell, 
good night, Mr. Rainsford; I hope you have a good night's rest." </p>
<p> The bed was good, and the pyjamas of the softest silk, and he was 
tired in every fibre of his being, but nevertheless Rainsford could not 
quiet his brain with the opiate of sleep. He lay, eyes wide open. Once 
he thought he heard stealthy steps in the corridor outside his room. He 
sought to throw open the door; it would not open. He went to the window 
and looked out. His room was high up in one of the towers. The lights 
of the chateau were out now, and it was dark and silent; but there was 
a fragment of sallow moon, and by its wan light he could see, dimly, 
the courtyard. There, weaving in and out in the pattern of shadow, were 
black, noiseless forms; the hounds heard him at the window and looked 
up, expectantly, with their green eyes. Rainsford went back to the bed 
and lay down. By many methods he tried to put himself to sleep. He had 
achieved a doze when, just as morning began to come, he heard, far off 
in the jungle, the faint report of a pistol. </p>
<p> General Zaroff did not appear until luncheon. He was dressed 
faultlessly in the tweeds of a country squire. He was solicitous about 
the state of Rainsford's health. </p>
<p> "As for me," sighed the general, "I do not feel so well. I am 
worried, Mr. Rainsford. Last night I detected traces of my old 
complaint." </p>
<p> To Rainsford's questioning glance the general said, "Ennui. 
Boredom." </p>
<p> Then, taking a second helping of cr¬êpes Suzette, the general 
explained: "The hunting was not good last night. The fellow lost his 
head. He made a straight trail that offered no problems at all. That's 
the trouble with these sailors; they have dull brains to begin with, 
and they do not know how to get about in the woods. They do excessively 
stupid and obvious things. It's most annoying. Will you have another 
glass of Chablis, Mr. Rainsford?" </p>
<p> "General," said Rainsford firmly, "I wish to leave this island at 
once." </p>
<p> The general raised his thickets of eyebrows; he seemed hurt. "But, 
my dear fellow," the general protested, "you've only just come. You've 
had no huntingó" </p>
<p> "I wish to go today," said Rainsford. He saw the dead black eyes of 
the general on him, studying him. General Zaroff's face suddenly 
brightened. </p>
<p> He filled Rainsford's glass with venerable Chablis from a dusty 
bottle. </p>
<p> "Tonight," said the general, "we will huntóyou and I." </p>
<p> Rainsford shook his head. "No, general," he said. "I will not 
hunt." </p>
<p> The general shrugged his shoulders and delicately ate a hothouse 
grape. "As you wish, my friend," he said. "The choice rests entirely 
with you. But may I not venture to suggest that you will find my idea 
of sport more diverting than Ivan's?" </p>
<p> He nodded toward the corner to where the giant stood, scowling, his 
thick arms crossed on his hogshead of chest. </p>
<p> "You don't meanó" cried Rainsford. </p>
<p> "My dear fellow," said the general, "have I not told you I always 
mean what I say about hunting? This is really an inspiration. I drink 
to a foeman worthy of my steelóat last." The general raised his 
glass, but Rainsford sat staring at him. </p>
<p> "You'll find this game worth playing," the general said 
enthusiastically." Your brain against mine. Your woodcraft against 
mine. Your strength and stamina against mine. </p>
<p> Outdoor chess! And the stake is not without value, eh?" </p>
<p> "And if I winó" began Rainsford huskily. </p>
<p> "I'll cheerfully acknowledge myself defeat if I do not find you by 
midnight of the third day," said General Zaroff. "My sloop will place 
you on the mainland near a town." The general read what Rainsford was 
thinking. </p>
<p> "Oh, you can trust me," said the Cossack. "I will give you my word 
as a gentleman and a sportsman. Of course you, in turn, must agree to 
say nothing of your visit here." </p>
<p> "I'll agree to nothing of the kind," said Rainsford. </p>
<p> "Oh," said the general, "in that caseóBut why discuss that now? 
Three days hence we can discuss it over a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, 
unlessó" </p>
<p> The general sipped his wine. </p>
<p> Then a businesslike air animated him. "Ivan," he said to Rainsford, 
"will supply you with hunting clothes, food, a knife. I suggest you 
wear moccasins; they leave a poorer trail. I suggest, too, that you 
avoid the big swamp in the southeast corner of the island. We call it 
Death Swamp. There's quicksand there. One foolish fellow tried it. The 
deplorable part of it was that Lazarus followed him. You can imagine my 
feelings, Mr. Rainsford. I loved Lazarus; he was the finest hound in my 
pack. Well, I must beg you to excuse me now. I always' take a siesta 
after lunch. You'll hardly have time for a nap, I fear. You'll want to 
start, no doubt. I shall not follow till dusk. Hunting at night is so 
much more exciting than by day, don't you think? Au revoir, Mr. 
Rainsford, au revoir." General Zaroff, with a deep, courtly bow, 
strolled from the room. </p>
<p> From another door came Ivan. Under one arm he carried khaki hunting 
clothes, a haversack of food, a leather sheath containing a long-bladed 
hunting knife; his right hand rested on a cocked revolver thrust in the 
crimson sash about his waist. </p>
<p> Rainsford had fought his way through the bush for two hours. "I 
must keep my nerve. I must keep my nerve," he said through tight teeth. </p>
<p> He had not been entirely clearheaded when the chateau gates snapped 
shut behind him. </p>
<p> His whole idea at first was to put distance between himself and 
General Zaroff; and, to this end, he had plunged along, spurred on by 
the sharp rowers of something very like panic. </p>
<p> Now he had got a grip on himself, had stopped, and was taking stock 
of himself and the situation. He saw that straight flight was futile; 
inevitably it would bring him face to face with the sea. He was in a 
picture with a frame of water, and his operations, clearly, must take 
place within that frame. </p>
<p> "I'll give him a trail to follow," muttered Rainsford, and he 
struck off from the rude path he had been following into the trackless 
wilderness. He executed a series of intricate loops; he doubled on his 
trail again and again, recalling all the lore of the fox hunt, and all 
the dodges of the fox. Night found him leg-weary, with hands and face 
lashed by the branches, on a thickly wooded ridge. He knew it would be 
insane to blunder on through the dark, even if he had the strength. His 
need for rest was imperative and he thought, "I have played the fox, 
now I must play the cat of the fable." A big tree with a thick trunk 
and outspread branches was near by, and, taking care to leave not the 
slightest mark, he climbed up into the crotch, and, stretching out on 
one of the broad limbs, after a fashion, rested. Rest brought him new 
confidence and almost a feeling of security. Even so zealous a hunter 
as General Zaroff could not trace him there, he told himself; only the 
devil himself could follow that complicated trail through the jungle 
after dark. But perhaps the general was a deviló An apprehensive night 
crawled slowly by like a wounded snake and sleep did not visit 
Rainsford, although the silence of a dead world was on the jungle. 
Toward morning when a dingy grey was varnishing the sky, the cry of 
some startled bird focused Rainsford's attention in that direction. 
Something was coming through the bush, coming slowly, carefully, coming 
by the same winding way Rainsford had come. He flattened himself down 
on the limb and, through a screen of leaves almost as thick as 
tapestry, he watched. . . . That which was approaching was a man. </p>
<p> It was General Zaroff. He made his way along with his eyes fixed in 
utmost concentration on the ground before him. He paused, almost 
beneath the tree, dropped to his knees and studied the ground. 
Rainsford's impulse was to hurl himself down like a panther, but he saw 
that the general's right hand held something metallicóa small 
automatic pistol. </p>
<p> The hunter shook his head several times, as if he were puzzled. 
Then he straightened up and took from his case one of his black 
cigarettes; its pungent incenselike smoke floated up to Rainsford's 
nostrils. </p>
<p> Rainsford held his breath. The general's eyes had left the ground 
and were travelling inch by inch up the tree. Rainsford froze there, 
every muscle tensed for a spring. But the sharp eyes of the hunter 
stopped before they reached the limb where Rainsford lay; a smile 
spread over his brown face. Very deliberately he blew a smoke ring into 
the air; then he turned his back on the tree and walked carelessly 
away, back along the trail he had come. The swish of the underbrush 
against his hunting boots grew fainter and fainter. </p>
<p> The pent-up air burst hotly from Rainsford's lungs. His first 
thought made him feel sick and numb. The general could follow a trail 
through the woods at night; he could follow an extremely difficult 
trail; he must have uncanny powers; only by the merest chance had the 
Cossack failed to see his quarry. </p>
<p> Rainsford's second thought was even more terrible. It sent a 
shudder of cold horror through his whole being. Why had the general 
smiled? Why had he turned back?p </p>
<p> Rainsford did not want to believe what his reason told him was 
true, but the truth was as evident as the sun that had by now pushed 
through the morning mists. The general was playing with him! The 
general was saving him for another day's sport! The Cossack was the 
cat; he was the mouse. Then it was that Rainsford knew the full meaning 
of terror. </p>
<p> "I will not lose my nerve. I will not." </p>
<p> He slid down from the tree, and struck off again into the woods. 
His face was set and he forced the machinery of his mind to function. 
Three hundred yards from his hiding place he stopped where a huge dead 
tree leaned precariously on a smaller, living one. Throwing off his 
sack of food, Rainsford took his knife from its sheath and began to 
work with all his energy. </p>
<p> The job was finished at last, and he threw himself down behind a 
fallen log a hundred feet away. He did not have to wait long. The cat 
was coming again to play with the mouse. </p>
<p> Following the trail with the sureness of a bloodhound came General 
Zaroff. Nothing escaped those searching black eyes, no crushed blade of 
grass, no bent twig, no mark, no matter how faint, in the moss. So 
intent was the Cossack on his stalking that he was upon the thing 
Rainsford had made before he saw it. His foot touched the protruding 
bough that was the trigger. Even as he touched it, the general sensed 
his danger and leaped back with the agility of an ape. But he was not 
quite quick enough; the dead tree, delicately adjusted to rest on the 
cut living one, crashed down and struck the general a glancing blow on 
the shoulder as it fell; but for his alertness, he must have been 
smashed beneath it. He staggered, but he did not fall; nor did he drop 
his revolver. He stood there, rubbing his injured shoulder, and 
Rainsford, with fear again gripping his heart, heard the general's 
mocking laugh ring through the jungle. </p>
<p> "Rainsford," called the general, "if you are within sound of my 
voice, as I suppose you are, let me congratulate you. Not many men know 
how to make a Malay mancatcher. </p>
<p> Luckily for me I, too, have hunted in Malacca. You are proving 
interesting, Mr. Rainsford. I am going now to have my wound dressed; 
it's only a slight one. But I shall be back. I shall be back." </p>
<p> When the general, nursing his bruised shoulder, had gone, Rainsford 
took up his flight again. It was flight now, a desperate, hopeless 
flight, that carried him on for some hours. </p>
<p> Dusk came, then darkness, and still he pressed on. The ground grew 
softer under his moccasins; the vegetation grew ranker, denser; insects 
bit him savagely. </p>
<p> Then, as he stepped forward, his foot sank into the ooze. He tried 
to wrench it back, but the muck sucked viciously at his foot as if it 
were a giant leech. With a violent effort, he tore his feet loose. He 
knew where he was now. Death Swamp and its quicksand. </p>
<p> His hands were tight closed as if his nerve were something tangible 
that someone in the darkness was trying to tear from his grip. The 
softness of the earth had given him an idea. </p>
<p> He stepped back from the quicksand a dozen feet or so and, like 
some huge prehistoric beaver, he began to dig. </p>
<p> Rainsford had dug himself in in France when a second's delay meant 
death. That had been a placid pastime compared to his digging now. The 
pit grew deeper; when it was above his shoulders, he climbed out and 
from some hard saplings cut stakes and sharpened them to a fine point. 
These stakes he planted in the bottom of the pit with the points 
sticking up. </p>
<p> With flying fingers he wove a rough carpet of weeds and branches 
and with it he covered the mouth of the pit. Then, wet with sweat and 
aching with tiredness, he crouched behind the stump of a 
lightning-charred tree. </p>
<p> He knew his pursuer was coming; he heard the padding sound of feet 
on the soft earth, and the night breeze brought him the perfume of the 
general's cigarette. It seemed to Rainsford that the general was coming 
with unusual swiftness; he was not feeling his way along, foot by foot. 
Rainsford, crouching there, could not see the general, nor could he see 
the pit. He lived a year in a minute. Then he felt an impulse to cry 
aloud with joy, for he heard the sharp crackle of the breaking branches 
as the cover of the pit gave way; he heard the sharp scream of pain as 
the pointed stakes found their mark. He leaped up from his place of 
concealment. Then he cowered back. Three feet from the pit a man was 
standing, with an electric torch in his hand. </p>
<p> "You've done well, Rainsford," the voice of the general called. 
"Your Burmese tiger pit has claimed one of my best dogs. Again you 
score. I think, Mr. Rainsford, I'll see what you can do against my 
whole pack. I'm going home for a rest now. Thank you for a most amusing 
evening." </p>
<p> At daybreak Rainsford, lying near the swamp, was awakened by a 
sound that made him know that he had new things to learn about fear. It 
was a distant sound, faint and wavering, but he knew it. It was the 
baying of a pack of hounds. </p>
<p> Rainsford knew he could do one of two things. He could stay where 
he was and wait. </p>
<p> That was suicide. He could flee. That was postponing the 
inevitable. For a moment he stood there, thinking. An idea that held a 
wild chance came to him, and, tightening his belt, he headed away from 
the swamp. </p>
<p> The baying of the hounds drew nearer, then still nearer, nearer, 
ever nearer. On a ridge Rainsford climbed a tree. Down a watercourse, 
not a quarter of a mile away, he could see the bush moving. Straining 
his eyes, he saw the lean figure of General Zaroff; just ahead of him 
Rainsford made out another figure whose wide shoulders surged through 
the tall jungle weeds; it was the giant Ivan, and he seemed pulled 
forward by some unseen force; Rainsford knew that Ivan must be holding 
the pack in leash. </p>
<p> They would be on him any minute now. His mind worked frantically. 
He thought of a native trick he had learned in Uganda. He slid down the 
tree. He caught hold of a springy young sapling and to it he fastened 
his hunting knife, with the blade pointing down the trail; with a bit 
of wild grapevine he tied back the sapling. Then he ran for his life. 
The hounds raised their voices as they hit the fresh scent. Rainsford 
knew now how an animal at bay feels. </p>
<p> He had to stop to get his breath. The baying of the hounds stopped 
abruptly, and Rainsford's heart stopped too. They must have reached the 
knife. </p>
<p> He shinned excitedly up a tree and looked back. His pursuers had 
stopped. But the hope that was in Rainsford's brain when he climbed 
died, for he saw in the shallow valley that General Zaroff was still on 
his feet. But Ivan was not. The knife, driven by the recoil of the 
springing tree, had not wholly failed. </p>
<p> Rainsford had hardly tumbled to the ground when the pack took up 
the cry again. </p>
<p> "Nerve, nerve, nerve!" he panted, as he dashed along. A blue gap 
showed between the trees dead ahead. Ever nearer drew the hounds. 
Rainsford forced himself on toward that gap. He reached it. It was the 
shore of the sea. Across a cove he could see the gloomy grey stone of 
the chateau. Twenty feet below him the sea rumbled and hissed. 
Rainsford hesitated. </p>
<p> He heard the hounds. Then he leaped far out into the sea. . . . </p>
<p> When the general and his pack reached the place by the sea, the 
Cossack stopped. For some minutes he stood regarding the blue-green 
expanse of water. He shrugged his shoulders. Then be sat down, took a 
drink of brandy from a silver flask, lit a cigarette, and hummed a bit 
from Madame Butterfly. </p>
<p> General Zaroff had an exceedingly good dinner in his great panelled 
dining hall that evening. With it he had a bottle of Pol Roger and half 
a bottle of Chambertin. Two slight annoyances kept him from perfect 
enjoyment. One was the thought that it would be difficult to replace 
Ivan; the other was that his quarry had escaped him; of course, the 
American hadn't played the gameóso thought the general as he tasted 
his after-dinner liqueur. In his library he read, to soothe himself, 
from the works of Marcus Aurelius. At ten he went up to his bedroom. He 
was deliciously tired, he said to himself, as he locked himself in. 
There was a little moonlight, so, before turning on his light, he went 
to the window and looked down at the courtyard. He could see the great 
hounds, and he called, "Better luck another time," to them. Then he 
switched on the light. </p>
<p> A man, who had been hiding in the curtains of the bed, was standing 
there. </p>
<p> "Rainsford!" screamed the general. "How in God's name did you get 
here?" </p>
<p> "Swam," said Rainsford. "I found it quicker than walking through 
the jungle." </p>
<p> The general sucked in his breath and smiled. "I congratulate you," 
he said. "You have won the game." </p>
<p> Rainsford did not smile. "I am still a beast at bay," he said, in a 
low, hoarse voice. "Get ready, General Zaroff." </p>
<p> The general made one of his deepest bows. "I see," he said. 
"Splendid! One of us is to furnish a repast for the hounds. The other 
will sleep in this very excellent bed. On guard, Rainsford." . . . </p>
<p> He had never slept in a better bed, Rainsford decided. </p>
